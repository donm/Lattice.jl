Lattice is a framework for automatically generating large amounts of machine
learning datasets. It constructs entire families of data generating
distributions, where each example in the distributions can be constructed
automatically along with perfect labels.  (Or imperfect labels--your choice.)

The code will be pushed to this repo once we receive approval to share it. You
can follow this repo or subscribe to issue #1 to be notified when the code is
released.
